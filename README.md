My undergrad research at [PIBIC nota 10][pibic10] program 

I co-designed with my advisor Dr. Annabell Del Real Tamariz the [Project Driven Data Science][project_driven_ds] research project to encompass my own and other research in Data Science at UENF.

<!-- My undergrad research on data science basic concepts, tools and scope. -->

- In the [first year][first_workplan] of my research I [reviewd][first_report] data science as a field, including its history, methods, tools, and concepts.

- In the [second year][second_workplan] I [developed][second_report] "[AcaDem][academ]", a data extraction and analysis script to generate information about the students of the university, specially to help course coordinators make informed decisions about subject offerings and resource allocation. I've also organized and taught an [introductory summer course][introds] on data science, helping students gain the skills and knowledge needed to start in this field.

- [Currently][third_workplan] I'm researching active inference, a promising area for understanding cognition and possibly building better tools to expand ours.
